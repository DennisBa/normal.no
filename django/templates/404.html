<!--
NOTE: Django returns 500 Server Error if no 404.html template exists.

The default 404 view will pass one variable to the template:
request_path, which is the URL that resulted in the error.

The 404 view is passed a RequestContext and will have access to
variables supplied by your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting (e.g.,
MEDIA_URL).
