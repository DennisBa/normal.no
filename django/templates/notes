Might move (app specific) templates to apps/*/template/ folder.
(Since TEMPLATE_LOADERS contain .app_directories.Loader)

UPDATE: must store in this dir, so drop it (files is duplicated)
  apps/files/templates/files/

UPDATE2: this is because doing this:
  render_to_response ('files/list.html'
If not prefixing with app name, then template loader will search all
app folders and pick the first that matches and there will be name
conflicts.

This can be fixed with this custom loader:
