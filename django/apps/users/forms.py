# If you don't want to use the built-in views, but want the convenience
# of not having to write forms for this functionality, the
# authentication system provides several built-in forms:

#from django.contrib.auth.forms import *
from django.contrib import auth

# auth.forms.
#   UserCreationForm
#   PasswordChangeForm
#   PasswordResetForm
